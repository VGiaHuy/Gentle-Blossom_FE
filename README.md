# About Gentle Blossom

The Gentle Blossom project uses ASP.NET Core Web API and ASP.NET Core MVC, with SQL Server as the database management system. Currently, this GitHub repository stores the source code for the Backend.

The Gentle Blossom website is a system built with the goal of meeting the healthcare needs of pregnant women and new mothers. My objective is to create an application that connects mothers with maternity care professionals and psychological counselors, helping them gain the health and knowledge needed to ensure their well-being and that of their children.
